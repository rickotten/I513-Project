the file named: HistoricalData_1617031823954.csv is S&P500 data from the Nasdaq website. 
the file named: every_index.csv is from the wharton wrds database. I executed a query that returned every data field for every index.  

The historical data file is ready to use and to be preprocessed and cleaned. 
The every index file is not ready to use. This is just an example of some of the possible data that can be returned from wharton wrds. 
I can refine my query and get any specific data we may want or need from wharton wrds database.
