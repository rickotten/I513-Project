I believe this api could be used to return cryptocurrency data: https://www.coinapi.io/ <br/>
with this data we could then calculate a weighted average formula and create our own "crypto index"<br/>
https://cci30.com/ this crypto index is a really good visualization, however I have not found a csv download for this data <br/>
