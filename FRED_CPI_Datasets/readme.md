Here is a break down and summary of what the Consumer Price Index is as well as CPI data: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm<br/>
^^ Here is a definition of CPI from investopedia.com (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20measures,of%20the%20government's%20economic%20policy.): <br/><br/>
The Consumer Price Index measures the average change in prices over time that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. <br/><br/>
CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation and, by proxy, of the effectiveness of the government's economic policy. <br/><br/>
CPI is important for measuring inflation. There is also the producer price index which may be of interest.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
